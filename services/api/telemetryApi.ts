/**
 * BPMN D6 routes the Executive Dashboard's KPIs through the API layer rather than computing them
 * in the browser, and that is not only an architecture preference - it is the only way the
 * numbers come out right.
 *
 * The telemetry functions aggregate ReservationRepository.getAllReservations(). Called from the
 * browser that read goes through the anon/user client and is filtered by RLS, and
 * `p_reservations_owner_read` only grants table-wide read to SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN,
 * BUILDING_MANAGER, GCI_MANAGER and RECEPTIONIST. Director, Executive Assistant, IT Admin and
 * Security Guard all pass the `analytics` permission check and all fall outside that policy, so
 * for them the aggregate silently collapsed to their own reservations - a Director opened the
 * executive dashboard and saw department shares, peak hours and the occupancy forecast computed
 * from their personal bookings, with no error to indicate it.
 *
 * Server-side the same repository resolves the service-role client, so these endpoints aggregate
 * the whole table. Access is gated by requirePermission('analytics', 'read') instead of by RLS.
